# ALU
Description:
This project, created by me(Aayushi Kumari), is all about building a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). An ALU is like a calculator inside a computer that can do basic math and logical operations on binary numbers (those made up of 0s and 1s).

Functionality:

Our ALU can do lots of things, like adding, subtracting, AND, OR, XOR (these are different types of calculations), and shifting bits (kind of like moving numbers around). It takes two 4-bit numbers and gives you an answer, along with some extra info like if there was a carry or if the result was zero.

Usage:

Get the project files onto your computer.
Make sure you have a program that can understand Verilog (a type of computer language).
Open the project in that program.
Use the testbench file to make sure the ALU is working correctly.
If you want to see it in action, use the Proteus file to simulate how it works.

Circuit Functionality:

It allows for the simulation of different arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and bitwise shifting on two 4-bit binary inputs.
